# Rock, Paper, Scissors

The task was to build a Rock Paper Scissors games for the user to go up against the computer.

## Setup 
The Github repository is to be cloned and from there no further installations are necessary. 

### Installation

* Viable across all operating systems. 

### Getting started

After the first alert which goes straight into announcing the first round of the game, the browser ask for input. Here the user decides whether to pick Rock (selected by typing 'R'), Paper (selected by typing 'P') or Scissors (selected by typing 'S')

## Usage
In order to run the game you simply must open the index.html file in any web browser and the game will automatically load upon the webpage opening of the browser.

## Errors and bugs
The game only takes the inputs R , P , S and not their lowercase versions. If any other characters are put in the game will ignore this and continue the rounds as if nothing had been inputted therefore no points will be scored by either the user or the computer.
